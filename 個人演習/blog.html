                Mew (Japanese: ミュウ , Hepburn: Myū) is one of the fictional species of creatures from Nintendo's and
                Game Freak's Pokémon media franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri. Mew is a small, pink, Psychic-type
                Mythical Pokémon.

            <p>
                It was added to Pokémon Red and Blue by its creator, Game Freak programmer Shigeki Morimoto, as an
                intended obtainable Pokemon. However, due to a lack of cartridge space, and the inability to
                write/add additional storyline/plot points to lead up to an in-game encounter with the Pokemon, it
                was ultimately not published within the game. It was still viewable within the game's background
                data, which led to the assumption and ultimate confirmation that it was originally intended to be
                released/published within the game. As such, its presence within the game's background data has been
                surrounded by rumors and myths, which contributed to making the Pokémon franchise a success. For
                years, Mew could not be legitimately obtained in the games except through Pokémon distribution
                events or via glitches.

                Mewtwo is a Pokémon, a fictional creature from Nintendo and Game Freak. Created by Ken Sugimori, it
                debuted in the video games Pokémon Red and Blue, and later appeared in subsequent sequels and
                spin-off titles, such as Pokken Tournament. In the video games, the player can fight and capture
                Mewtwo in order to subsequently pit it against other Pokémon. The player first learns of Mewtwo late
                in Pokémon Red and Blue by reading research documents left in a ruined laboratory on Cinnabar
                Island. Mewtwo is regarded as one of the series' strongest Pokémon, and was the strongest in the
                original games in terms of stats. It is known as the "Genetic Pokémon" and is a Legendary Pokémon, a
                special group of Pokémon that are very rare and usually very powerful. Mewtwo has also appeared in
                various animated adaptations of the franchise.

                Mewthree is a joke.
